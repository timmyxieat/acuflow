# 1.16_3 - Status Color Simplification

**Date:** 2024-12-14
**Type:** UX / Color System
**Objective:** Simplify appointment status colors by unifying "no action needed" states

---

## Summary

Changed the Scheduled status color from yellow to slate gray, matching the Completed status. This reduces cognitive load by using color only for states that require attention.

## What Changed

### Before
| Status | Color | Hex |
|--------|-------|-----|
| Scheduled | Yellow | `#eab308` |
| Unsigned | Amber | `#f59e0b` |

**Problem:** Yellow and amber were too similar, making it hard to distinguish at a glance.

### After
| Status | Color | Hex |
|--------|-------|-----|
| Scheduled | Slate | `#94a3b8` |
| Completed | Slate | `#94a3b8` |
| Unsigned | Amber | `#f59e0b` |

## Key Decisions

### Why same color for Scheduled and Completed?
Both are "no action needed" states:
- **Scheduled** - waiting, nothing to do yet
- **Completed (signed)** - done, nothing to do anymore

Colors are now reserved for states requiring attention:
- **Green** - Checked In (start treatment)
- **Blue** - In Progress (active)
- **Amber** - Unsigned (needs signature)
- **Red** - Cancelled/No Show (problem)

### Why not just change Unsigned?
Amber is semantically correct for Unsigned - it's a warning that needs action. Scheduled has no urgency and should be visually quieter.

## Final Status Color Palette

| Status | Color | Hex | Meaning |
|--------|-------|-----|---------|
| Scheduled | Slate | `#94a3b8` | No action needed |
| Checked In | Green | `#22c55e` | Patient ready |
| In Progress | Blue | `#3b82f6` | Active treatment |
| Unsigned | Amber | `#f59e0b` | Needs signature |
| Completed | Slate | `#94a3b8` | No action needed |
| Cancelled | Red | `#ef4444` | Problem |
| No Show | Red | `#ef4444` | Problem |

## Files Modified

- `src/lib/constants.ts` - STATUS_COLORS and STATUS_TEXT_COLORS
- `src/data/mock-data.ts` - getStatusDisplay() function
- `.claude/rules/colors.md` - Documentation updated, old "Questions to Resolve" removed

## Follow-up Considerations

- **Appointment Type Colors:** Brief Follow-up still uses Amber, same as Unsigned status. If this causes confusion in practice, consider changing Brief Follow-up to Violet (`#8b5cf6`).
