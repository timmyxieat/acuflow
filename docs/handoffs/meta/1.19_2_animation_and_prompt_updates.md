# 1.19_2 - Animation Tweaks & Prompt Updates

**Date:** 2024-12-14
**Type:** Meta / UX Polish
**Objective:** Refine PatientCard animations and fix handoff naming convention

---

## Summary

Two small improvements this session:
1. Updated PatientCard expand/collapse animations with delayed opacity and reversed slide direction
2. Fixed the meta handoff prompt to prevent version number mistakes

---

## Animation Changes

### PatientCard Expand/Collapse

Updated `FADE_SLIDE_TRANSITION` in `src/lib/animations.ts`:

**Before:**
- Name and status title slid in from right to left (`x: 16` → `x: 0`)
- No delay on opacity
- Same transition for enter and exit

**After:**
- Slide direction reversed: left to right (`x: -16` → `x: 0`)
- 0.1s delay on enter (layout settles first, then text fades in)
- Exit is immediate (no delay, 0.15s duration)

### Why the delay?
When expanding from compact mode, the avatar and card width animate via spring transition. The delay lets this layout animation start first, then the name/status text fades in - creating a more polished staggered effect.

## Prompt Update

Updated `docs/prompts/starting_and_ending.md`:

**Problem:** The meta session ending prompt used `{current_version}` but didn't explain how to find it. This led to wrong version numbers in handoff filenames.

**Fix:**
- Added explicit instruction to replace `{VERSION}` with actual version before sending
- Added guidance: "Check the latest handoff doc in `docs/handoffs/` to find the current version"
- Updated examples to be more concrete (`1.19_1_status_colors.md` instead of `1.XX_1_...`)

## Files Modified

- `src/lib/animations.ts` - FADE_SLIDE_TRANSITION updated (slide direction + delay)
- `src/components/custom/PatientCards.tsx` - Removed redundant transition prop
- `docs/prompts/starting_and_ending.md` - Clearer version number instructions

## Files Renamed (by user)

- `docs/handoffs/meta/1.16_3_status_color_simplification.md` → `1.19_1_status_color_simplification.md`
