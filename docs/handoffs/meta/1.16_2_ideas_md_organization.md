# 1.16_2 - Ideas.md Organization

**Date:** 2024-12-14
**Type:** Meta / Project Organization
**Objective:** Reorganize `docs/ideas.md` for tracking and AI agent interaction

---

## Summary

Transformed ideas.md from an unstructured feature wishlist into an actionable tracking document with status markers. Added AI agent instructions so assistants can check and update feature status as they work.

## What Changed

### Before
- Freeform bullet list of ideas grouped by area
- No indication of what was implemented vs planned
- No guidance for AI assistants

### After
- Checkbox format: `[ ]` not done, `[x]` done
- Completed items moved to bottom of each section (incomplete work visible first)
- AI agent instructions in HTML comment at top
- Status audit performed against codebase

## Format Decisions

### Why `[ ]` and `[x]` only (no partial state)
User preferred simplicity over granularity. Original proposal included `[~]` for partial, but:
- Harder to edit as a human (not a standard toggle)
- Binary done/not-done is clearer
- Partial items just stay unchecked until fully complete

### Why completed items at bottom
- Incomplete work is what you need to see
- Scanning top of section shows remaining work
- Completed items serve as reference/history

### AI Agent Instructions
Added HTML comment block explaining:
1. Check this file before implementing features
2. Mark `[x]` when fully implemented
3. Add new ideas with `[ ]`
4. Update as part of final commits
5. Move completed items to bottom

## Status Audit Results

Based on codebase exploration:

| Section | Done | Not Done |
|---------|------|----------|
| Patient Cards | 5 | 0 |
| Treatment Timer | 5 | 0 |
| Today Screen | 7 | 4 |
| Search | 2 | 2 |
| SOAP Note UX | 2 | 2 |
| Patient Intake | 0 | 5 |
| General UI | 0 | 1 |
| Sidenav | 0 | 1 |

## Files Modified

- `docs/ideas.md` - Complete rewrite with status markers

## Convention Established

AI assistants working on this project should:
1. Check `docs/ideas.md` before implementing features
2. Update status when completing features
3. Add new ideas discovered during development
